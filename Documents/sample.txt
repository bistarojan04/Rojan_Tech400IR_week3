@105840 Hi there! What device is this happening on? If you could also let us know the Android and Spotify versions you're using, that'd be great /AY
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Version 8.4.22.857 armv7 on anker bluetooth speaker on Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2016) Model SM-T280 Does distance from speaker matter?
@105840 Thanks. The distance could possibly affect playback. Does logging out &gt; restarting your device &gt; logging back in make a difference? /AY
@SpotifyCares No, but I've moved speaker to about 1 metre away and it's not skipping at the mo - it was about 3 or 4 metres away before. Fingers crossed!

@105855 Hi Thomas, if a colleague believes the person buying alcohol looks under 25, they will be challenged for ID to prove they're of age. - Paige
@Tesco Maybe hire colleagues who can see?
@Tesco The point is if it's enforced they do it properly or they don't. Plus take some common-sense and think does that person look over 18?
@105855 Hi Thomas, this is correct but this helps our store colleagues judge age and protect them from making underage sales. Amanda
@Tesco Uk offlicense law is 18. Not 25
@105855 Hi Thomas, we operate a Think 25 policy at our stores. I'd be flattered to be ID'd. :-) - Helena
Got id's @Tesco for buying one Adnams Broadside. Is being blind part of the job-spec? I am 35 and 99 kilos.
@105856 Hi there, could you try deleting your cache and cookies and reinstalling the app if using it? This should fix the issue :) - Dani
@Tesco Will I lose all the shopping I've done if I delete the cache/cookies (not using app)?
@105856 Hi there, as long as you sign out of your account prior to deleting your cache &amp; cookies, you'll still have a full basket :) Thanks - Mike
@Tesco Done all that. Still telling me there are no delivery slots whatsoever.
@105856 Can you DM me your full name, address and email? I'd be happy to look into this further for you :) Thanks - Mike
Hey @Tesco, your website's broken. It's telling me there are no delivery slots for the next 3 weeks, which I find slightly unlikely.
@105857 Is there a particular app that seems to cause these issues more than others? What model iPhone are you using? Join us in DM. https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT
@AppleSupport I have the latest version iOS. It started immediately after I updated my phone.
@105857 We'd like to help if we can. When did this start happening? Which version of iOS are you running currently?
My apps stop working without warning and my phone freezes every five minutes! Love the new update @76099!!!!

@105859 UPS has a service called My Choice that will allow your packages to be delivered to UPS Store. ^ML  https://t.co/BPZKndqww1 https://t.co/wKJHDXWGRQ
@105860 I wish Amazon had an option of where I can just get it shipped to the ups store so I can avoid a lot of the struggle
They reschedule my shit for tomorrow https://t.co/RsvZcT982t
@105861 Hey Sara, sorry to hear of the issues you are having, can I ask if it's the lay out or just the speed of the website responding? TY - Chris
@Tesco bit of both - finding the layout cumbersome and when removing an item from faves - getting a huge slowdown. Not keen on the thin green line https://t.co/9281OKEebk
@105861 If that doesn't help please DM your full name, address and email including the browser and device so we can log this. Thanks - Lee 2/2
